# Introduction

Daily Rewards GUI is a simple plugin created for management for Spigot server daily rewards. The Rewards are completely customizable (from custom action-lists to GUI display) with customizable cooldowns. They are all displayed in a nice GUI (making it nice is your job in this scenario).

# Compiling

If you wish to compile the plugin yourself, you can do so using Maven. It was built against Spigot 1.16
